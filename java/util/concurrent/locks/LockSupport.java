/**
 * LockSupport类，是JUC包中的一个工具类，是用来创建锁和其他同步类的基本线程阻塞原语。
 * Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other
 * synchronization classes.
 *
 * LockSupport类使用了一种名为Permit（许可）的概念来做到阻塞和唤醒线程的功能，可以把许可看成是一种(0,1)信号量（Semaphore），
 * 但与 Semaphore 不同的是，许可的累加上限是1。
 * 初始时，permit为0，当调用unpark()方法时，线程的permit加1，当调用park()方法时，如果permit为0，则调用线程进入阻塞状态。
 *
 * <p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit
 * (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore
 * Semaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately
 * if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise
 * it <em>may</em> block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit
 * available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores
 * though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)
 *
 * LockSupport类的核心方法其实就两个：park()和unark()，其中park()方法用来阻塞当前调用线程，unpark()方法用于唤醒指定线程。
 * 这其实和Object类的wait()和signial()方法有些类似，但是LockSupport的这两种方法从语意上讲比Object类的方法更清晰，
 * 而且可以针对指定线程进行阻塞和唤醒。
 * <p>Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient
 * means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the
 * problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}
 * and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races
 * between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying
 * to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the
 * permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller's
 * thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The
 * {@code park} method may also return at any other time, for "no
 * reason", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks
 * conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an
 * optimization of a "busy wait" that does not waste as much time
 * spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be
 * effective.
 *
 * <p>The three forms of {@code park} each also support a
 * {@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while
 * the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to
 * identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may
 * access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker(Thread)}.)
 * The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this
 * parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as
 * a {@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.
 *
 * <p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating
 * higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves
 * useful for most concurrency control applications.  The {@code park}
 * method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:
 *
 *
 * 假设现在需要实现一种FIFO类型的独占锁，可以把这种锁看成是ReentrantLock的公平锁简单版本，
 * 且是不可重入的，就是说当一个线程获得锁后，其它等待线程以FIFO的调度方式等待获取锁。
 *  <pre> {@code
 * while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }}</pre>
 *
 * where neither {@code canProceed} nor any other actions prior to the
 * call to {@code park} entail locking or blocking.  Because only one
 * permit is associated with each thread, any intermediary uses of
 * {@code park} could interfere with its intended effects.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out
 * non-reentrant lock class:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class FIFOMutex {
 *   private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);
 *   private final Queue<Thread> waiters
 *     = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Thread>();
 *
 *   public void lock() {
 *     boolean wasInterrupted = false;
 *     Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
 *     waiters.add(current);
 *
 *     // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
 *     // 如果当前线程不在队首，或锁已被占用，则当前线程阻塞
 *     // NOTE：这个判断的意图其实就是：锁必须由队首元素拿到
 *     while (waiters.peek() != current ||
 *            !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
 *       LockSupport.park(this);
 *       if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting
 *         wasInterrupted = true;
 *     }
 *     // 删除队首元素
 *     waiters.remove();
 *     if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit
 *       current.interrupt();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void unlock() {
 *     locked.set(false);
 *     LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * 上述FIFOMutex 类的实现中，当判断锁已被占用时，会调用LockSupport.park(this)方法，将当前调用线程阻塞；
 * 当使用完锁时，会调用LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek())方法将等待队列中的队首线程唤醒。
 * 通过LockSupport的这两个方法，可以很方便的阻塞和唤醒线程。但是LockSupport的使用过程中还需要注意以下几点：
 * 1.park方法的调用一般要方法一个循环判断体里面。之所以这样做，是为了防止线程被唤醒后，不进行判断而意外继续向下执行，这其实是一种Guarded Suspension的多线程设计模式。
 * 2.park方法是会响应中断的，但是不会抛出异常。(也就是说如果当前调用线程被中断，则会立即返回但不会抛出中断异常)
 * 3.park的重载方法park(Object blocker)，会传入一个blocker对象，所谓Blocker对象，
 * 其实就是当前线程调用时所在调用对象（如上述示例中的FIFOMutex对象）。该对象一般供监视、诊断工具确定线程受阻塞的原因时使用。
